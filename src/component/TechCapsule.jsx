          A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry 
        capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where 
        you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, 
        and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.
