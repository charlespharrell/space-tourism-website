          A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to carry a 
          payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or beyond. Our 
          WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation. Standing 150 metres tall, 
          it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!
